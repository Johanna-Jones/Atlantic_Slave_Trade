The Atlantic Slave trade is a dark and fascinating part of our shared history and I want to explore how it pans out through the tool of Graph Data Science.

The key objectives are:

1. Clean and conduct EDA on the given data and its supplementary tables
2. Perform community detection, Network Analysis and Node centrality on the dataset.
